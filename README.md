Gerard Braad's application descriptions
=======================================

Application install/uninstall descriptions for use with [`app.zsh`](https://github.com/gbraad-dotfiles/upstream/blob/main/zsh/.zshrc.d/app.zsh), and the [`action`](https://github.com/Actionfile/action.sh) (Actionfile executor).

The `apps.md` helper script is a utility designed to provide a fuzzy, interactive interface for managing and executing application actions defined in these Markdown files.
